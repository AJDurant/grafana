# Templates

Templates are both a starting point and an instruction manual for writing something new. They are intended to make life easier by providing a jumping-off point, something besides a blank page to start from. They are not intended to be a limitation. If the template does not work perfectly for your use case, you can adjust or change it. We will work it out in code review.

## Create a template

## Use a template

1. Read the template. Make sure you understand what it is for and how it is intended to be used.
1. Copy and rename the template. Move it to where you actually need it.
   You might also want to copy the content of the template and paste it into a different file. This is acceptable use.
1. Replace the template content with your own. Delete whatever is unnecessary.

## Documentation templates

In an ideal world, each topic will correspond to an information *type* ([task](doc-task-template.md), [reference](doc-reference-template.md), [concept](doc-concept-template.md)) and contain only that type of information.

However, this is not always practical. For example, you have a series of short topics, you can group them into one topic.

Try to *chunk* your content. This means you should organize the document so that the same kinds of content are grouped together.

### Chunking example

If I was writing a topic called *Doggie handbook*, I might organize it like this. 

**Concept**
* What a dog is
* Brief history of dogs
* Why you might want a dog
* Tasks dogs can be trained to do
  
**Tasks**
* Feed the dog
* Groom the dog
* Train the dog

**Reference**
* List of dog equipment you will need
* Table of breeds that includes breed name, size range, short or long hair, and type of dog
